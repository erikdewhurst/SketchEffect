# SketchEffect
This asset helps you to create a pencil sketch effect in Unity. All you have to do is create a material with the “SktechEffect” shader, assign necessary textures, and apply it to your game object. 

Note this is not a post-processing shader. The post-processing shader feature is planned for future releases.

- Unity 2021.3 and above
